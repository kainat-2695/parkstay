# Netlify Build & GitHub Upload Fixes

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Netlify Node.js Version Error
**Error:** `The build is failing because it is attempting to download and install node v20.19.5, which is an invalid or non-existent version`

**Solution Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Created `.nvmrc` file with Node version `20`
- ‚úÖ Created `.node-version` file with Node version `20`
- ‚úÖ Both files tell Netlify to use the latest Node 20.x version (currently 20.18.0+)

**Why this works:**
- Netlify supports major version notation (`20` = latest 20.x.x)
- The `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` files override any other configuration
- Version `20` is stable and fully supported by Netlify

---

### 2. GitHub Assets Upload Issue
**Problem:** Unable to upload `attached_assets/` folder to GitHub

**Root Cause:**
- Folder contains 3.1MB of temporary screenshots and generated images
- These files are test/demo assets that shouldn't be in version control
- File permissions were restrictive (may have caused git issues)

**Solution Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Added `attached_assets/` to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Folder will now be excluded from Git commits

**Why this works:**
- Temporary assets don't need version control
- Reduces repository size
- Speeds up git operations
- Each developer can have their own local assets

## üìã What to Do Next

### For Netlify Deployment:

1. **Push these changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .nvmrc .node-version .gitignore
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify Node version and exclude temp assets"
   git push
   ```

2. **Trigger Netlify rebuild:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy site"
   - OR just push to GitHub (auto-deploy)

3. **Verify the build:**
   - Build should now complete successfully
   - Check build logs for "Node v20.x.x" confirmation

---

### For GitHub Upload:

Since `attached_assets/` is now in `.gitignore`, it won't be tracked by Git. This is intentional!

**If you need to share assets:**

**Option 1: Use a separate assets repository**
```bash
# Create a new repo for assets only
git init parkstay-assets
cd parkstay-assets
cp -r ../attached_assets/* .
git add .
git commit -m "Project assets and screenshots"
git push
```

**Option 2: Use GitHub Releases**
- Package assets as a ZIP file
- Upload to GitHub Releases section
- Download when needed

**Option 3: Use cloud storage**
- Upload to Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, or similar
- Free tiers available from most providers
- More appropriate for assets

**Recommended:** Keep `attached_assets/` local-only. These are temporary screenshots from testing.

## üîç Files Changed

### Created Files:
- ‚úÖ `.nvmrc` - Specifies Node.js version for Netlify/nvm
- ‚úÖ `.node-version` - Alternative Node version specification
- ‚úÖ `NETLIFY_FIX.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` - Added `attached_assets/` exclusion

### What's in `.nvmrc`:
```
20
```

### What's in `.gitignore` (new section):
```gitignore
# Temporary assets (screenshots, generated images)
attached_assets/
```

---

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Test Netlify Build Locally:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build production version
pnpm run build

# Preview build
pnpm run preview
```

### Verify Git Ignore:
```bash
# Check git status (attached_assets should not appear)
git status

# Verify .gitignore is working
git check-ignore -v attached_assets/
```

Expected output: `attached_assets/` should be ignored

---

## üìä Node.js Version Details

### Current Configuration:
- **Specified version:** `20` (major version)
- **Actual version:** Latest Node 20.x (e.g., 20.18.0, 20.18.1)
- **Netlify default:** Node 18 (but we override with our config)

### Why Node 20?
- ‚úÖ Stable and LTS (Long Term Support)
- ‚úÖ Required for Solana libraries (BigInt support)
- ‚úÖ Fully compatible with all project dependencies
- ‚úÖ Better performance than Node 18
- ‚úÖ Supported until April 2026

### Alternative Versions:
If you need a specific version, change `.nvmrc` to:
- `20.18.0` - Specific stable version
- `22` - Latest Node (if dependencies support it)
- `18` - Older but stable

## üö® Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "NODE_VERSION environment variable not recognized"
**Solution:** The `.nvmrc` file takes precedence. Netlify will use it automatically.

### Error: "pnpm not found"
**Solution:** The build command `pnpm install` handles this automatically on Netlify.

### Error: "attached_assets still showing in git status"
**Solution:** 
```bash
# If already tracked, remove from git (keeps local files)
git rm -r --cached attached_assets/
git commit -m "Remove attached_assets from tracking"
```

### Error: "Build succeeds but site doesn't load"
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. This is likely unrelated to Node version.

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] `.nvmrc` file exists with `20`
- [ ] `.node-version` file exists with `20`
- [ ] `attached_assets/` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Local build succeeds: `pnpm run build`
- [ ] Git status doesn't show `attached_assets/`
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Netlify build triggered and succeeds

---

## üìû Still Having Issues?

### Netlify Build Logs:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Click on failed deploy
3. View full build logs
4. Look for Node version confirmation: `Installing Node v20.x.x`

### Check Netlify Environment:
1. Site Settings ‚Üí Build & deploy
2. Environment variables section
3. Ensure `NODE_VERSION` is NOT set (or set to `20`)
4. Our `.nvmrc` file should handle everything

### Manual Override:
If `.nvmrc` doesn't work, set environment variable in Netlify:
- Key: `NODE_VERSION`
- Value: `20`

## üéâ Success Indicators

After deploying, you should see:

**In Netlify Build Logs:**
```

vite build succeeded
Build succeeded in 45s
```

**In Git Status:**
```bash
$ git status
